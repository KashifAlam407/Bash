=========== Bash Full Form =================
Bash = Bourne Again SHell.
Its a command line interpreter (shell) for linux/unix system.

======= Main Purpose ========
1 -> Run commands interactively.
2 -> Automate system tasks with scripts.
3 -> Chain multiple programs/tools together easily (perfect for hacking automation!).


======== Shell vs Bash vs Terminal ========
1 -> Shell :-- The interface between user ane OS (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.).
2 -> Bash :-- A specific popular shell.
3 -> Terminal :-- The window/app where you type shell commands.


======= How Bash Executes commands =======
* Interpreter model (like python) --> Executes line by line.
Bash Example:--
    print("Hello Hacker")

* Reads script directly, no compilation step (unlike C/C++).
Python Example:-- 
    #!/bin/bash
    $ echo "Hello Hacker"

C Example:--
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main(){
        printf("Hello Hacker/n");
        return 0;
    }


======== Setting Up Bash ========
*To Install bash (Linux/Unix, Ubuntu/Debian):-
    $ sudo apt-get install bash ## to install bash 

*Most Unix/Linux systems come with Bash pre-installed.
    $ bash --version  ## To check if bash is installed
