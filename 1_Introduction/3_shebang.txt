====== Purpose of Shebang (#!) =======
It tells the operating system which interpreter should execute the script.


#!/bin/bash → Run the script using the Bash shell



====== You could also use ========

#!/usr/bin/python3 → For Python scripts

#!/bin/sh → For general POSIX shell

#!/usr/bin/env bash → For portable Bash (Linux/macOS/WSL/Windows Git Bash)



===== When is shebang really needed =======
* when you run the script directly like this:-
    ./variable.sh
** The OS relies on the shebag to decide which interpreter to use.


==== Your script run without shebang also ====
* if you manually ran it with Bash like this:-
    bash variable.sh
** When you run it this way, you're explicitly telling the system to use Bash, so the shebang is not needed.
