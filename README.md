## About
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default shell on most Unix-like systems. It combines scripting, automation, and command-line power—ideal for developers, sysadmins, and DevOps professionals.

---

## Use Cases
- **Automate tasks**: Backups, deployments, log processing.
- **System administration**: User management, package updates, system monitoring.
- **DevOps scripting**: CI/CD pipelines, build automation.
- **Server & Docker workflows**: Container builds, orchestration, and maintenance.

## Bash vs Other Programming Languages

| Feature              | Bash                            | Python / JavaScript          | C / Java                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Syntax complexity    | Simple syntax, tailored to shell context | High-level, general-purpose | Strict, compiled, verbose         |
| Performance          | Fast for shell tasks, less so for heavy computation | Moderate, optimized libraries | High-performance compiled code    |
| Error handling       | Limited, via exit codes & traps | Rich exception handling | Strong, structured exception / error handling |
| Use case             | Shell automation, CLI tasks | General scripting & apps | System/software engineering       |

**Why use Bash?**  
- It's already installed on most servers.
- Integrates seamlessly with Unix tools like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`.
- Ideal for light automation and environment setup.
