===== Using the ls commands ======
The ls commands is used to list the contents of a directory.
The ls commands can display files, directories, and information about them.



========= Options Overview ==========
The ls command has a variety of options to customize its output:-
    -l - Long listing format
    -a - Include hidden files
    -h - Human-readable sizes
    -t - Sort by modification time
    -r - Reverse order while sorting
    -R - List subdirectories recursively
    -S - Sort by file size
    -1 - List one file per line
    -d - List directories themselves, not their contents
    -F - Append indicator (one of */=@|) to entries

======== Long Listing Format =========
The -l options gives you detailed information about files and folders.

It displays information such as:
    file permissions
    number of links
    owner name
    owner group
    file size
    time of last modification
    file or directory name

Example:-   $ ls -l
This format is useful for getting a comprehensive overview of the file attributes.



========= Hidden Files ==========
The -a option includes hidden files in the listing.

Hidden files in Unix/Linux systems start with a dot (e.g., .bashrc).

This option is helpful when you need to view or manage configuration files that are not visible by default.

Example:-    $ ls -a



========= Human-Readable Sizes =========
The -h option makes file sizes easier to read by converting byte counts into kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), etc.

This option is particularly useful when you want to quickly assess the size of files and directories without manually converting bytes.

The -h option only works when used with -l (long listing format).

Example:-   $ ls -h  
## above command doesn't change much visually because -h only effects size display in -l long format
            $ ls -lh 
## above command long listing with human-readable sizes (KB, MB, GB, etc.)



=========== Sorting by Time =============
The -t option sorts files and directories by modification time, with the most recently modified files first.

This option is useful when you want to see the most recently updated files first.

Example:- ls -t
